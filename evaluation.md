#Evaluation
By the end of this project, everything that I had originally aimed to complete was successfully completed well. I struggled on the leaderboard data organisation, but that was quickly fixed. I believe the skills developed here have wider scope and could be applied to many other projects, in particular the use of file I/O.

If I were to do this again, I would spend less time on the design stage, because it was very time consuming yet did not entirely prepare me for the actual development.

I would like to further develop the integration of multi-dimensional arrays as I believe their use can be beneficial in concisely storing data. I believe that the leaderboard went well as an extension activity, as did the question-asking program, because I like the use of the user's input easily translating to their answer in the correction section.
