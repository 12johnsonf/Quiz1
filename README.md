# Quiz
Spring Term Computing Project:

A train based Python Quiz.
The program will:

    • Ask for name.
    • Welcome by name.
    • Ask 5 multiple choice questions
        if correct add one to player score.
    • Print name, player answers and total score at the end.
    • If score > 6 print 'Well Done' 5 times.
    • Add to leaderboard and print top 10.

Developement stages:

1. [X] List what your quiz needs to be able to do. Plan the quiz program you are going to make. Flowcharts, pseudo code or any other sensible method of showing how your program will work.

2. [X] Write a program to ask the player their name and then welcome them to the quiz. For example: 
  ```
  First name: Jerry
  Hello Jerry, welcome to the train quiz.
  ```
  Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
