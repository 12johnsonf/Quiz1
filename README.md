# Quiz
Spring Term Computing Project:

A train based Python Quiz.
The program will:

    • Start by asking for your name. 
    • Welcome you to the quiz by name. 
    • Ask five multiple choice question
    • For each question, if the player has the correct answer, add one to their score.
    • At the end of the quiz display the player's name and score.
    • Display Well Done 5 times if a player has a score of more than 3.

Developement stages:

1. List what your quiz needs to be able to do. Plan the quiz program you are going to make. Flowcharts, pseudo code or any other sensible method of showing how your program will work.

2. Write a program to ask the player their name and then welcome them to the quiz. For example: 
  ```
  What is your name? Jerry
  Hello, Jerry welcome to the cheeze quiz.
  ```
  Test your program works then give evidence of your code.

3. Add code to your program so asks a question and takes in an answer, for example:
  ```
  Question One:
  Which of the following is a goat cheese?
  1) Cheddar 
  2) Caprino 
  3) Stilton 
  4) Brie 
  Enter your answer:  2
  ```
  Test the program works.
  
4. Improve the program so it adds one to the score if the player gets the answer right. Test the program works.

5. Add four more questions to the quiz. Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
 
6. When the quiz is over acid code so it prints out the player's score. Jerry has a score of: 5 
Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
