# Quiz
Spring Term Computing Project:

A train based Python Quiz.
The program will:

    • Ask for name.
    • Welcome by name.
    • Ask 5 multiple choice questions
        if correct add one to player score.
    • Print name, player answers and total score at the end.
    • If score > 3 print 'Well Done' 5 times.
    • Add to leaderboard and print top 10.

Developement stages:

1. List what your quiz needs to be able to do. Plan the quiz program you are going to make. Flowcharts, pseudo code or any other sensible method of showing how your program will work.

2. Write a program to ask the player their name and then welcome them to the quiz. For example: 
  ```
  What is your name? Jerry
  Hello, Jerry welcome to the cheeze quiz.
  ```
  Test your program works then give evidence of your code.

3. Add code to your program so asks a question and takes in an answer, for example:
  ```
  1) Which of the following is a goat cheese?
  Cheddar 
  Caprino 
  Stilton 
  Brie 
  Enter your answer:  Caprino
  ```
  Test the program works.
  
4. Improve the program so it adds one to the score if the player gets the answer right. Test the program works.

5. Add four more questions to the quiz. Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
 
6. When the quiz is over acid code so it prints out the player's score. Jerry has a score of: 5 
Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
