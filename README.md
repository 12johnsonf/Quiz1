# Quiz
Spring Term Computing Project:

A train based Python Quiz.
The program will:

    • Ask for name.
    • Welcome by name.
    • Ask 5 multiple choice questions
        if correct add one to player score.
    • Print name, player answers and total score at the end.
    • If score > 3 print 'Well Done' 5 times.
    • Add to leaderboard and print top 10.

Developement stages:

1. [X] List what your quiz needs to be able to do. Plan the quiz program you are going to make. Flowcharts, pseudo code or any other sensible method of showing how your program will work.

2. [X] Write a program to ask the player their name and then welcome them to the quiz. For example: 
  ```
  What is your name? Jerry
  Hello, Jerry welcome to the cheeze quiz.
  ```
  Test your program works then give evidence of your code.

3. [X] Make questions array and question asking program:
  ```
  1) Which of the following is a goat cheese?
  Cheddar 
  Caprino 
  Stilton 
  Brie 
  Enter your answer:  Caprino
  ```
  Test the program works.
  
4. [X] Improve the program so it adds one to the score if the player gets the answer right. Test the program works.

5. [ ] When the quiz is over add code so it prints out the player's score with answers. Test your program works then give evidence of your code.

6. [ ] Add a leaderboard to the quiz. Test your program works then give evidence of your code.
